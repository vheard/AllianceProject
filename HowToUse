Any user who chooses to use our application will quickly find out that it is very easy to use. 
We have provided the users with a simple, yet serviceable application that make the daily responsibilities of managing a hotel extremely straightforward.
There are particular graphical user interfaces for each type of user, which will allow one to undertake proper tasks or requests. 
The specific GUI viewed will be contingent upon how the user is stored in the database. 
The manager must store the employee information in the department section as follows: a – admin, h – housekeepers, d – desk attendant. 
A manager will log in and have three options of booking a room, managing employees, or viewing room service requests. 
The main duty of the manager is to manage all employees
Since they are a manager, they will also be able to assist desk attendants in booking a room or view and inform housekeepers of pending requests. 
Hiring (adding) and firing (deleting) of employees can be done if the manager selects the manage employees option. 
The manager can also edit an employee’s information in the case of their being some incorrect stored information or a change in position. 
A desk attendant has to ability to book rooms by simply entering a guest’s general identification and payment information. The desk attendants also have the ability check the status of a guest’s room. 
Housekeepers will use the application to view/update and pending requests. 
Guests will have a separate module they log in to make room service requests (services, needs, foods, etc.). 
They will submit their requests so that the housekeepers will be able to view them.
